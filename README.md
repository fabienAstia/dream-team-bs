## Initialize the project
Make sure you have installed in latest version :
- Node (required)
- Git (required)
- Visual Studio Code

#### #1 Clone the repository
HTTPS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabienAstia/dream-team-bs.git
```

#### #2 Install dependencies
Open the project and run NPM 
```bash
npm install
```

## Create a custom Bootstrap
### Sass
Customize Bootstrap by modifying variables/mixins in `custom.scss` (location root : src/scss/custom.scss). 

Choose your Bootstrap components in `imports.scss` (location root : src/scss/custom.scss).

The project uses [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) (a distribution of Dart Sass) to compile and minify the CSS output. 

To compile, minify and watch changes, run
```bash
npm run build-css
```

This will update 3 files in the dist/ folder :
 - `dream-team-bs.css`  CSS version of all customs and imports
 - `dream-team-bs.min.css`  minified CSS version
 - `dream-team-bs.min.css.map`  mapping version - allow to link minify version to original (debug)

The first two files can be directly linked to HTML's <head> to apply the custom Bootstrap. Please, prefer to use the **minified version**.

Now, the project is entering watching mode. Every time you make a change in `custom.scss`, the code will be compiled and minified.

*Tip : You can use the index.html file and go live (Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code) to see changes.*

### Javascript
Choose your Javascript modules in the `main.js` file (location root : src/js/main.js).

#### Rollup (Popper CDN)
The project uses [Rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup) to compile and minify the JS output. 
Popper/Core is **include manually via CDN link**.

Make sure the following CDN is in HTMLâ€™s <head> (required placement : between `dream-team-bs.min.css.min.css` link and the future `dream-team-bs.umd.min.js` script):
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-IQsoLXl5PILFhosVNubq5LC7Qb9DXgDA9i+tQ8Zj3iwWAwPtgFTxbJ8NT4GN1R8p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Example
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../dist/dream-team-bs.min.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-IQsoLXl5PILFhosVNubq5LC7Qb9DXgDA9i+tQ8Zj3iwWAwPtgFTxbJ8NT4GN1R8p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script type="module" src="../dist/dream-team-bs.umd.min.js"></script>
```

Now, you can configure the input/output javascript in `rollup.config.js` as you want or use the default configuration already in place.

To bundle your imports and configuration, run :
```bash
npm run build-js
```
As before, this will generate a minified JS file. You can link it to your HTML's <head>.

## Commands summary
Use bash
 - `npm run build-css` Compiles Sass into CSS and watches changes
 - `npm run build-js` Import and minify js files with Rollup - using CDN for Popper
 - `npm start` Run both command (js and css)

At any time, you can modify commands in `package.json`
